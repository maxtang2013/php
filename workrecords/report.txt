Hi everyone, first of all, I'm so glad to be a part of this team.  
Now I want to stop today,

1), Tested the normal functionalities of the website (join, login, upload photo, etc.).
2), Tried to use the automated testing tool, Selenium IDE (as well as php-webdriver). It works fine on static pages. I'm still trying to figure out how to use it on dynamic pages.
3), Read some dolphin framework code, learning the ordinary structure of a page.

1). TNH-5 => Edit profile page, doesn't warn user that the username can be changed only once.
	Changed the email to an address that doesn't exist, I got an alert window, but the email address wasn't reverted to the old valid one.

2). TNH-6 => Upload photo dialog, there is no default album. The combo box on that dialog is empty, looks wired.

3). TNH-7 => Edit profile page, two birthday fields don't match.

4). Tested the site.
