Hi everyone, first of all, I'm so glad to be a part of this team.  
Now I want to stop today,

1), Tested the normal functionalities of the website (join, login, upload photo, etc.).
2), Tried to use the automated testing tool, Selenium IDE (as well as php-webdriver). It works fine on static pages. I'm still trying to figure out how to use it on dynamic pages.
3), Read some dolphin framework code, learning the ordinary structure of a page.

1), Right automated test cases for some of the webpages, include the main page, the help page, 	the login page, and the edit profile page.
2), Tested the normal functionalities of the website, by hand and/or by using automated test tools.
3), Read Selenium webdriver tutorial documents.
4), Read api.ai online documents.
5), Create simple agents and test it on the website.
