Hi everyone, first of all, I'm so glad to be a part of this team.  
Now I want to stop today,

1), Tested the normal functionalities of the website (join, login, upload photo, etc.).
2), Tried to use the automated testing tool, Selenium IDE (as well as php-webdriver). It works fine on static pages. I'm still trying to figure out how to use it on dynamic pages.
3), Read some dolphin framework code, learning the ordinary structure of a page.
