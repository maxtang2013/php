Previously, I worked for startups IT companies as well as listed companies like Tencent. I worked in different types of projects, from websites to games, from PC platform to mobiles. I have a good understanding of the basics of programming and software engineering, including Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Design Patterns. I'm a focused and detail-oriented Software Engineer offering very good troubleshooting skills and I'm aways passionate on solving difficult problems in the software world.
Right now I'm living in the country side in Hunan Province in southern China, with my wife, my son and two cats. In my spare time, my favorite sport is hiking, as both my wife and I are nature lovers.
